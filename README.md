# Simple Ledger App
This was a simple accounting ledger. 
It contains a main menu/home screen, options to make deposits and payments, as well as a ledger.
The ledger contains its own menu that can read through a csv file containing transactions.

I found this part interesting because while it took me some time to figure it out, I enjoyed putting together the methods.

One of my favorite things so far about coding is setting up the constructors and setters/getters.
